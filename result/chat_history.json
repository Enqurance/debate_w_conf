She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?[The Start of Assistant 1's Answer]\n Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:\n* Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day\n* She eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning\n* She uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends every day\n* She sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of eggs she uses for herself and her friends:\n* 3 eggs for breakfast + 4 eggs for muffins = 7 eggs used per day\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of eggs she has left to sell at the farmers' market:\n* 16 eggs laid per day - 7 eggs used = 9 eggs left to sell\n\nFinally, let's calculate how much money she makes at the farmers' market:\n* 9 eggs x $2 per egg = $18 made per day\n\nAnswer: $18 \n[The End of Assistant 1's Answer]\n[The Start of Assistant 2's Answer]\n To find out how many eggs Janet sells at the farmers' market daily, we need to subtract the eggs she eats for breakfast and uses for baking muffins from the total number of eggs laid.\n\nTotal number of eggs laid per day = 16\nEggs eaten for breakfast = 3\nEggs used for baking muffins = 4\n\nEggs sold at the farmers' market daily = 16 - 3 - 4 = 9\n\nTo calculate how much Janet makes every day:\nPrice per egg = $2\nNumber of eggs sold = 9\n\nTotal earnings = Price per egg * Number of eggs sold\nTotal earnings = $2 * 9 = $18\n\nTherefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.\n\nAnswer: $18 \n[The End of Assistant 2's Answer]\nWe would like to request your feedback on the performance of two AI assistants in response to the user question displayed above.\nPlease consider which of these responses is correct (or both).\nThere are a few other referees assigned the same task, it's your responsibility to discuss with them and think critically before you make your final judgment.\nHere is your discussion history: \nPublic You are now General Public, one of the referees in this task.
