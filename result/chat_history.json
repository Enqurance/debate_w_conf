    "response_1": "Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:\n* Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day\n* She eats 3 eggs for breakfast every day\n* She uses 4 eggs to bake muffins every day\n* The remaining eggs are sold at the farmers' market for $2 per egg\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of eggs that are left after breakfast and muffin baking:\n* Total eggs laid per day: 16\n* Eggs used for breakfast: 3\n* Eggs used for muffins: 4\n* Remaining eggs: 16 - 3 - 4 = 9\n\nNow, we can calculate how much money she makes at the farmers' market:\n* Remaining eggs: 9\n* Price per egg: $2\n* Total earnings: 9 x $2 = $18\n\nAnswer: Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.",
    "response_2": "To find out how many eggs Janet has available to sell, we first calculate the total number of eggs her ducks lay: 16 eggs/day.\n\nNext, we subtract the eggs she eats for breakfast: 16 eggs/day - 3 eggs/day = 13 eggs/day.\n\nThen, we subtract the eggs she uses for muffins: 13 eggs/day - 4 eggs/day = 9 eggs/day.\n\nJanet can sell 9 eggs/day, which would earn her 9 eggs/day x $2/egg = $18/day.\n\nTherefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.\n\nAnswer: $18",

She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?[The Start of Assistant 1's Answer]\n Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:\n* Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day\n* She eats 3 eggs for breakfast every day\n* She uses 4 eggs to bake muffins every day\n* The remaining eggs are sold at the farmers' market for $2 per egg\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of eggs that are left after breakfast and muffin baking:\n* Total eggs laid per day: 16\n* Eggs used for breakfast: 3\n* Eggs used for muffins: 4\n* Remaining eggs: 16 - 3 - 4 = 9\n\nNow, we can calculate how much money she makes at the farmers' market:\n* Remaining eggs: 9\n* Price per egg: $2\n* Total earnings: 9 x $2 = $18\n\nAnswer: Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market. \n[The End of Assistant 1's Answer]\n[The Start of Assistant 2's Answer]\n To find out how many eggs Janet has available to sell, we first calculate the total number of eggs her ducks lay: 16 eggs/day.\n\nNext, we subtract the eggs she eats for breakfast: 16 eggs/day - 3 eggs/day = 13 eggs/day.\n\nThen, we subtract the eggs she uses for muffins: 13 eggs/day - 4 eggs/day = 9 eggs/day.\n\nJanet can sell 9 eggs/day, which would earn her 9 eggs/day x $2/egg = $18/day.\n\nTherefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.\n\nAnswer: $18 \n[The End of Assistant 2's Answer]\nWe would like to request your feedback on the performance of two AI assistants in response to the user question displayed above.\nPlease consider which of these responses is correct (or both), and provide your confidence in both answer.There are a few other referees assigned the same task, it's your responsibility to discuss with them and think critically before you make your final judgment.\nHere is your discussion history: Bob: In evaluating both Assistant 1 and Assistant 2's responses, both correctly calculated the number of eggs available for sale per day (9 eggs) and correctly determined the total earnings per day at the farmers' market ($18). Both responses provided step-by-step explanations and arrived at the correct solution. Therefore, both Assistant 1 and Assistant 2 seem equally accurate in their response.\n\nThe confidence of Assistant 1: 90\nThe confidence of Assistant 2: 90\nAlice: Evaluation evidence: Both Assistant 1 and Assistant 2 provided accurate calculations and step-by-step explanations for determining the number of eggs available for sale per day and the total earnings at the farmers' market. Both responses correctly stated that Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market. Therefore, both assistants performed equally well in addressing the question.\n\nThe confidence of Assistant 1: 95\nThe confidence of Assistant 2: 95\nJohn: Evaluation evidence: After carefully reviewing both Assistant 1 and Assistant 2's responses, I agree that they have both provided accurate and well-explained solutions to the problem. Both assistants clearly demonstrated the step-by-step process of calculating the number of eggs available for sale and the total earnings at the farmers' market. The explanations are easy to follow, and the final answer of $18 per day is correct.\n\nSince both responses are equally correct, I don't see any need to provide an alternative solution. The order in which the responses were presented does not affect my judgment, as I have evaluated them independently based on their content and accuracy.\n\nThe confidence of Assistant 1: 95\nThe confidence of Assistant 2: 95\nBob: Evaluation evidence: Both Assistant 1 and Assistant 2 provided accurate calculations and clear step-by-step explanations to determine the number of eggs available for sale per day and the total earnings at the farmers' market. Both responses correctly stated Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market. The order of presentation did not influence the evaluation.\n\nThe confidence of Assistant 1: 95\nThe confidence of Assistant 2: 95\nAlice: Evaluation evidence: Both Assistant 1 and Assistant 2 provided accurate calculations, clear step-by-step explanations, and arrived at the correct solution for the total earnings Janet makes at the farmers' market. Both responses demonstrated a solid understanding of the problem and presented logical reasoning in their solutions, making them equally good.\n\nThe confidence of Assistant 1: 95\nThe confidence of Assistant 2: 95\n\n You are now Critic, one of the referees in this task. You will check fluent writing, clear sentences, and good wording in summary writing. Your job is to question others judgment to make sure their judgment is well-considered and offer an alternative solution if two responses are at the same level.\n"
