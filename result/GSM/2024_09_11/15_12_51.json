She eats 3 for breakfast and bakes 4 for muffins. \n\nFirst, let's find out how many eggs she uses in total for eating and baking: \n3 (for breakfast) + 4 (for muffins) = 7 eggs\n\nNow, let's subtract the eggs she used from the total number of eggs: \n16 (total eggs) - 7 (eggs used) = 9 eggs\n\nJanet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg. To find out how much she makes, we multiply the number of eggs she sells by the price per egg: \n9 (eggs sold) * $2 (price per egg) = $18\n\nSo, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.\n\nAnswer: $18",
