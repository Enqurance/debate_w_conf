    "response_1": "Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:\n* Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day\n* She eats 3 eggs for breakfast every day\n* She bakes muffins with 4 eggs every day\n* She sells the remainder at the farmers' market for $2 per egg\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many eggs she has left to sell:\n* Total eggs laid per day: 16\n* Eggs used for breakfast: 3\n* Eggs used for muffins: 4\n* Eggs left to sell: 16 - 3 - 4 = 9\n\nNow, we can calculate how much she makes at the farmers' market:\n* Price per egg: $2\n* Eggs left to sell: 9\n* Total revenue: 9 x $2 = $18\n\nAnswer: Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.",
    "response_2": "First, let's calculate how many eggs Janet has remaining after eating three for breakfast and using four for baking muffins: \n\n16 eggs - 3 breakfast eggs - 4 baking eggs = 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 eggs\n\nThen we can calculate how much money she makes daily from selling the remaining eggs:\n\n9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18\n\nTherefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.\n\nAnswer: $18",
