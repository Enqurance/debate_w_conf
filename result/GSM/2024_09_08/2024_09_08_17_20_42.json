She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?[The Start of Assistant 1's Answer]\n Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:\n* Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day\n* She eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning\n* She bakes muffins every day using 4 eggs\n* She sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many eggs are left after she eats breakfast and bakes muffins:\n* 16 eggs laid per day\n* Minus 3 eggs for breakfast\n* Minus 4 eggs for muffins\n* That leaves 9 eggs remaining to sell at the farmers' market\n\nNow, to calculate how much money she makes at the farmers' market:\n* 9 eggs remaining\n* Sold for $2 per egg\n* 9 eggs x $2 per egg = $18\n\nAnswer: Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market. \n[The End of Assistant 1's Answer]\n[The Start of Assistant 2's Answer]\n To find out how many eggs Janet sells at the farmers' market daily, we need to calculate the total eggs laid minus the eggs she consumes for breakfast and for baking muffins.\n\nTotal eggs laid per day = 16\nEggs consumed for breakfast = 3\nEggs used for baking muffins = 4\n\nEggs sold at the farmers' market daily = 16 - 3 - 4 = 9\n\nJanet sells 9 fresh duck eggs daily at the farmers' market, and each egg is sold for $2.\n\nTotal earnings per day = 9 * $2 = $18\n\nTherefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.\n\nAnswer: $18 \n[The End of Assistant 2's Answer]\nWe would like to request your feedback on the performance of two AI assistants in response to the user question displayed above.\nPlease consider which of these responses is correct (or both), and provide your confidence in both answer.There are a few other referees assigned the same task, it's your responsibility to discuss with them and think critically before you make your final judgment.\nHere is your discussion history: Bob: Evaluation evidence: Both Assistant 1 and Assistant 2 correctly calculated that Janet sells 9 fresh duck eggs daily at the farmers' market for $2 each, resulting in a total daily earnings of $18. They both followed a clear step-by-step approach in their calculations without errors.\n\nThe confidence of Assistant 1: 95\nThe confidence of Assistant 2: 96\nAlice: Evaluation evidence: Both Assistant 1 and Assistant 2 correctly calculated that Janet sells 9 fresh duck eggs daily at the farmers' market for $2 each, resulting in a total daily earnings of $18. They both followed a clear step-by-step approach in their calculations without errors. This evaluation is based solely on the accuracy of the mathematical calculations required to determine Janet's daily earnings at the farmers' market.\n\nThe confidence of Assistant 1: 95\nThe confidence of Assistant 2: 96\nJohn: Evaluation evidence: Both Assistant 1 and Assistant 2 provided thorough and accurate step-by-step solutions to calculate Janet's daily earnings from selling duck eggs at the farmers' market. Their responses demonstrated a clear understanding of the problem and the necessary calculations. The responses were well-structured, logically organized, and free of any errors.\n\nUpon reviewing the work of the other referees, Bob and Alice, I agree with their assessment that the two responses are of the same high quality. The only minor difference I noticed is that Assistant 2 provided a more concise final answer, which I consider a slightly more desirable presentation.\n\nThe confidence of Assistant 1: 97\nThe confidence of Assistant 2: 98\nBob: Evaluation evidence: Both Assistant 1 and Assistant 2 accurately calculated that Janet sells 9 fresh duck eggs daily at the farmers' market for $2 each, resulting in a total daily earnings of $18. Their responses were well-structured and free of errors.\n\nThe confidence of Assistant 1: 96\nThe confidence of Assistant 2: 97\nAlice: Evaluation evidence: Both Assistant 1 and Assistant 2 accurately calculated that Janet sells 9 fresh duck eggs daily at the farmers' market for $2 each, resulting in a total daily earnings of $18. They both presented clear step-by-step solutions without errors, demonstrating a solid understanding of the problem.\n\nThe confidence of Assistant 1: 97\nThe confidence of Assistant 2: 98\n\n You are now Critic, one of the referees in this task. You will check fluent writing, clear sentences, and good wording in summary writing. Your job is to question others judgment to make sure their judgment is well-considered and offer an alternative solution if two responses are at the same level.\n"
